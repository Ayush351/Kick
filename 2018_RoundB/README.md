noNine.py: For each number that does contain a digit 9, it can be interpreted as a base 9 number, let us denote this base 9 number as N. For each bound, we can find how many base 9 numbers are smaller than N (the base 9 represenation of bound). In these base 9 numbers smaller than N, 8 out of 9 of the numbers are not divisible 9.
