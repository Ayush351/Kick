specializingVillages.py: The official analysis suggested we sort the edges based on weight, but that is at least O (E log E) complexity, and in my honest opinion that approach is not optimal. My approach is somewhat different: Since all edges have different values, if we select the smallest outgoing edge from each vertex, we would get a spanning forest (We cannot have a loop because all edges have different value, and a loop would contradict the strictly greater than relationship). The number of ways would be pow(2, number of spanning forest). Notice a special case here: if we have an edge with weight 0, with two endpoints spa and spb, then the neighbors of spa and spb can also be viewed as spanning components. Thus in the exponential part we add (number of neighbors of spa and spb)-2. The final answer would be pow(2, number of spanning forest + number of neighbors of spa and spb - 2 )
