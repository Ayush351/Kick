ennergyStones.py: we cannot apply a direct dp because the order matters. Instead, we greedily compare two of the intervals and thus rank the priority of stones. Once the order is set, we can translate this problem to knapsack dp, similar to course schedule (https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/). What is so so special about this question is that we do not need to consider stones that have 0 energy (at the time of inspection)! Because for the sequence of stones we eat, we never eat a 0 energy stone (it is a waste of time), and thus we only need to consider the priority among the non-zero stones!
